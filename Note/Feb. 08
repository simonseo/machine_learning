Model f_w(x) is the function, defined by parameter vector w, that maps the vector x to a real number.
Linear Model is f_w(x) = w·x

(Linear algebra recap)

Add the bias by inserting x_0 = 1

W in a linear model represents a separating hyperplane.
To be able to define a linear model, the data has to be linearly separable.

correctly classified if y(i)(w · x^(i)) > 0
